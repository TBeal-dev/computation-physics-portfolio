# Computational Physics Work Portfolio
This github repository is a compilation of projects completed over the course of a computational physics college-level class. The projects provided entailed independent research into each topic.

## Projects

### Project 0: Plinko Board
The goal of this project was to model a plinko board in python. During the creation of the project, I decided to conduct an experiment to test if the balls starting position has any effect on how long it takes the ball to reach the bottom. The project's results include a scatter plot and a curve fit in order to better analyze the results of the project.

### Project 1: Rocket Motion
##### Collaborated with Justin Riccardelli, Student at High Point University
This project was focused around modeling rocket motion. We modeled the rocket with the use of ODE's, specifically with the Euler method. Furthermore, we analyzed the rockets distance traveled, velocity, momentum and mass of the rocket.

### Project 2: Simulation of a Golf Ball
##### Collaborated with Justin Riccardelli, Student at High Point University
The simulation of a golf ball is unique due to various factors. These include, but are not limited to, the dimples on a golf ball. Without dimples, a golf ball's flight would be drastically different. This project was aimed at simulation the motion of a golf ball with a variety of golf clubs.

### Project 3: Modeling Coupled Oscillators
##### Collaborated with Justin Riccardelli, Student at High Point University
For this project, we modeled couple oscillators with the use of various ODE methods, including Euler, RK2 and RK4. The results were visualized with the use of graphs and simulations in python.

### Final Project: Ant Trails
##### Collaborated with Justin Riccardelli, Student at High Point University
For the final project, we turned our focus to ant trails. Ant trails occur when ant find food and signal to other ants, by dropping a chemical trail, where the food is located. This allows ants to find and bring back food to the ant nest. While in a completely different scope compared to other projects, this simulation utilized agent-based modeling.
